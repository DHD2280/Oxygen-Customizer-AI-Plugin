# ü§ñ How it works

This plugin uses some code from [removebg](https://github.com/AppcentMobile/removebg) library to remove the background from an image using pytorch.
This plugin also uses ONNX Runtime to run AI Models on Android.

# üöÄ Usage

Send a broadcast with the image source path and the destination path to save the extracted image.
Remember to add a package name, so the app will send an intent on success or failure.

```java
Intent intent = new Intent("it.dhd.oxygencustomizer.aiplugin.REQUEST_EXTRACT_SUBJECT");
intent.putExtra("sourcePath", "/path/to/image.png");
intent.putExtra("destinationPath", "/path/to/save/extracted/image.png");
intent.setPackage("your.package.name");
sendBroadcast(intent);
```

If something goes wrong, the plugin will send a broadcast with the error message.
Intent action: `it.dhd.oxygencustomizer.aiplugin.ACTION_EXTRACT_FAILURE`

If the extraction is successful, the plugin will send a broadcast to the calling package.
Intent action: `it.dhd.oxygencustomizer.aiplugin.ACTION_EXTRACT_SUCCESS`

NOTE: The generated subject is always compressed as [PNG](./app/src/main/java/it/dhd/oxygencustomizer/aiplugin/receivers/SubjectExtractionReceiver.java).
